# EmployeeAttritionAnalysis

**Introduction:**

Understanding and reducing turnover within a business is the main problem at hand. Employee
attrition, which is defined as an employee leaving the organization either voluntarily (like with a
resignation) or involuntarily (like with a layoff), causes big problems. High attrition rates can have
negative effects on the company, including increased operating expenses, the loss of important
people and institutional knowledge, and disruptions in productivity and workflow. For businesses
aiming for stability and sustainable growth, solving this issue is crucial. Organizations can apply
strategic initiatives to improve employee retention, maximize worker efficiency, and create a more
favorable and thriving work environment by understanding the underlying reasons and patterns of
turnover.

What are the major trends and causes of employee attrition within the organization? is the main
substantive question that this analysis aims to answer. In other words, our goal is to find the root
causes and patterns behind employee departures from the firm.

**Dataset:**

• "left_company," "department," "job_level," "business_travel," "job_satisfaction,"
"performance_rating," and "marital_status" are character (chr) variables, likely
representing categorical or textual data.

• "Salary," "weekly_hours," "yrs_at_company," "yrs_since_promotion,"
"previous_companies," and "miles_from_home" are numeric or integer variables, likely
representing quantitative data.

• "X" appears to be a logical (logi) variable, and it contains missing values (NA).
